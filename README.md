# Kriptografi Tugas

This repository contains a cryptography-related project that includes encryption and decryption functionality using Python. The project is structured with a simple Python web application that demonstrates how cryptographic algorithms can be implemented and applied.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main application file that runs the cryptographic operations.
- `ciphers.py`: Contains various cryptographic algorithms.
- `cipherteks.txt`: A sample text file containing encrypted data.
- `encrypted.bin`: Binary file storing encrypted data.
- `static/`: Directory containing CSS and other static assets.
- `templates/`: HTML files for the web front-end.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required Python libraries (you can install them via `pip install numpy` ).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zayni46/Kriptografi-tugas.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Kriptografi-tugas
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the web application, which you can access in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Features

- **Encryption/Decryption**: The project allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using algorithms implemented in `ciphers.py`.
- **Web Interface**: The application features a simple web interface where users can input plaintext and get the encrypted result, or vice versa.
